<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>You can work on the assignment in one of two ways: locally on your own machine, or on a virtual machine on Google Cloud. </p>
<h3>Working remotely on Google Cloud (Recommended)</h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> after following these instructions, make sure you go to <strong>Download data</strong> below (you can skip the <strong>Working locally</strong> section).</p>
<p>As part of this course, you can use Google Cloud for your assignments. We recommend this route for anyone who is having trouble with installation set-up, or if you would like to use better CPU/GPU resources than you may have locally. Please see the set-up tutorial <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/gce-tutorial/">here</a> for more details. :)</p>
<h3>Working locally</h3>
<p><strong>Installing Anaconda:</strong>
If you decide to work locally, we recommend using the free <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda Python distribution</a>, which provides an easy way for you to handle package dependencies. Please be sure to download the Python 3 version, which currently installs Python 3.6. We are no longer supporting Python 2.</p>
<p><strong>Anaconda Virtual environment:</strong>
Once you have Anaconda installed, it makes sense to create a virtual environment for the course. If you choose not to use a virtual environment, it is up to you to make sure that all dependencies for the code are installed globally on your machine. To set up a virtual environment, run (in a terminal)</p>
<p><code>conda create -n cs231n python=3.6 anaconda</code></p>
<p>to create an environment called <code>cs231n</code>.</p>
<p>Then, to activate and enter the environment, run</p>
<p><code>source activate cs231n</code></p>
<p>To exit, you can simply close the window, or run</p>
<p><code>source deactivate cs231n</code></p>
<p>Note that every time you want to work on the assignment, you should run <code>source activate cs231n</code> (change to the name of your virtual env).</p>
<p>You may refer to <a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html">this page</a> for more detailed instructions on managing virtual environments with Anaconda.</p>
<p><strong>Python virtualenv:</strong>
Alternatively, you may use python <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">virtualenv</a> for the project. To set up a virtual environment, run the following:</p>
<p>```bash
cd assignment1
sudo pip install virtualenv      # This may already be installed
virtualenv -p python3 .env       # Create a virtual environment (python3)</p>
<h1>Note: you can also use "virtualenv .env" to use your default python (please note we support 3.6)</h1>
<p>source .env/bin/activate         # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies</p>
<h1>Work on the assignment for a while ...</h1>
<p>deactivate                       # Exit the virtual environment
```</p>
